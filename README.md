# World_Weather_Analysis

## Project Overview

This challenge had three primary deliverables. The first goal was to create 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes, retrieve the nearest city, and perform an API call with the OpenWeather Map. The second goal was to ask the user for certain inputs to identify ideal travel destinations with nearby hotels. The results will be displayed on Google maps with pop-up markers. The final goal was to utilize Google Directions API and create a travel itinerary that shows the route between four cities chosen from the travelers destinations. This map will also contain pop-up markers for each city on the itinerary.
